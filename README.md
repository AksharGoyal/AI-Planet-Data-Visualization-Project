# AI Planet Data Visualization Project
Project as part of Data Visualizaion

As part of the [Data Visualization](https://aiplanet.com/bootcamp/certificate/verify/b7d5e327-0d0c-497e-8020-e08f76ed1daf) bootcamp organized by AI Planet formerly DPhi around May 2022, I had to work on a project that showed my understanding of data visualization. I took the [Top Apps in Google Play](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrparkhomenko/top-apps-in-google-play) dataset as the basis for the project and shared insights I found on from the data.

Working on data visualization helped me find value in data and realize not everything has to be about machine learning in data science.

Feel free to explore the notebook and enjoy learning ðŸ’¹
